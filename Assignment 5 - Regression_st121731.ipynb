    "Despite of its usage, Gradient Descent proves to run slower compared to other algorithms of regression models. Its running time may be dependent to the alpha we used in the simulation above. Lower alphas can provide better accuracy to its model. HOwever, one advantage to this is that it will provide a very slow running time. The OLS performed faster among the models shown from above. Normal equations for the closed form OLS will solve directly the coefficients and parameters of the Linear Regression model. In this way, running time of OLS is faster. \n",

However, if you look very closely between the Gradient Descent against Pseudo-inverse, they almost had the same Mean Squared Error. But Pseudo-inverse runs faster than the Gradient Descent since it only requires X and its inverse from (X.TX)-1 X.T. But the downsize to this is that there is no guarantee that every regression problem, pseudo-inverse will exist. It only exists when (X.TX)-1 is non-singulat, and in this case, the Beta is unique.  "

    "It is important to note how each algorithms and formulas work within a specific problem. In this example, we are presented with regression models by solving the method analytically (closed form equations) and by solving its optimization algorithms, such as Gradient Descent. As expected, in terms of running time and accuracy, OLS and Ridge (sklearn) provides better accuracy compared to an optimization algorithm. These normal equations have faster convergence than Gradient Descent. This is because Gradient Descent heavily relies with the usage of its alpha. Alpha is the learning step on how it converges to obtain the local minima. It is important to note that when alpha is too large, Gradient Descent can increase the training error. When alpha is small, the algorithm may be stuck with a high training error. The sklearn-Stochastic GD performs faster than Batch GD. Stochastic gradient descent typically reaches convergence much faster than batch  gradient descent since it updates weight more frequently. The SGD computes the gradient of the whole training set and tries to find the max and min from a single traininng dataset. In this way, it generates too much noise. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, this example shows how important is it to obtain the assumptions of every regression model. Though most algorithms work in these types of problems, assumption testing is important if our objective is to obtain the highest accuracy among these regression problems. Closed-form solutions are much preferred for smaller datasets, since matrices are not a concern. If we want to obtain a regression model that discards multicollinearity and matrix singularity, we can use Gradient Descent(Batch or Stochastic), especially for larger datasets."
